I struggle to start this post because writing a blog has always been something I wanted to do for various reasons.  Every time I tried to start, another excuse would "block" me from doing something I believed I'd genuinely enjoy.  I would tell myself I need to be better before putting myself out there, but the truth is that by that logic, I will never be good enough.  As I've gotten older, I've realized that the process is even more important than the result, and having the ability to embrace failure is actually a skill by itself.  

While priorities may change throughout my posts, the initial goal is to document my learning process, keep myself accountable, and share some of my thesis' along the way.  Most of my learning will focus on technology advancements and how they can be practically introduced into an existing architecture ecosystem.  All of that is to say, I expect to be wrong while I take this journey, but how else does anyone improve?

While I may not be the resident expert I used to expect myself to be, all anyone can do is try to be better.  Disappointment will happen when striving for growth, but no one should be judged by their failures alone, yet by how they react to said failure.
